1. QR decomposition with pivoting is implemented in Python to match R's
2. Constant columns removal is seperately implemented by sd detection
3. Phase II: Python lm in BootRestHDCI is also filled with NAs to match R's lm() and Python's Phase I
5. p.adjust (BY BH) is translated as python, which can handle NAs
   statsmodels' multipletest is replaced with that
   In R:
    BY is used by IFAA()
    BH is used by runlinear()
6.

To-Do after R is updated

1. df_cor in runBootLassoHDCI is replaced by QR method
